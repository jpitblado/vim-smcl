# smcl.vim

Syntax file for editing Stata help and smcl files.

## Installation

I use [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
to install Vim plugins.
If you do too, then you can use the following to install this plugin:

```sh
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/jpitblado/vim-smcl.git smcl
```

## Future plans

This version is more up-to-date than the one at vim.org;
I hope to get these two sites in sync. 

I have some mappings I would like to add.
